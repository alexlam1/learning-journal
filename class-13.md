#Class 13 week 3 day 3
Now, I'm defiently stressing myself out, spending way too much time finishing the day 1 BusMall and feeling way to far  behind, from what I hear yesterday and today were easy and fast assignments. And at least I'm spending the time going through these trials and errors so I get more practice with coding, I do feel like things are starting to click, but I defiently am not close to taking the training wheels off. I'm not going to give up and im done putting myself so down about things. Hopefully I'll be able to finish soon tommorow so I can get tues, wednesday assignments done, then I can finally feel at least caught up. I plan to do assignment re submissions over the weekend i'm going to meet up with Ed and study.
