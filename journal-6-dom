# Journal day 6 DOM
I spent all class until 6 working out bugs and trying really hard to move from the 3rd problem to the 4th. Finally I threw in the towel and decided to just open it up again when I got home from school. I do feel like I got pretty far though.
I'm not sure wether to just focus on this code or to go back and revise my old one.
today I learned about DOM operators and using functions in them. I also worked on html and css again.
