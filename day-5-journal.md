#Day 5 journal
  Today was supposed to be easy so I kept my mind focused on not overthinking, that didn't help to well, either its the fact that reading instructions is still a little complicated or I don't fully understand writing functions which is totally fine being we just started using functions.

  For question 1 and 2 we didn't have to change anything, this was fine but as soon as I got into the 3rd question I kept trying to change my function but couldn't quite get it to work properly! Finally after trial and error because I worked on this at home. I accomplished this problem, again, I was just over thinking it.
