# class 15 week 3 day 5 201
This week has been my least favorite in terms of complications with the programming, which istotally ok because i'm not alone in this boat. I feel like I am retaining a lot more then i did the firsgt week and im able to apply some things ive learned in class to my coding. Going into the projects im very excited about because finally we get to build an app of our choice and problem solve as a team without random requirments or specific ways of doing things. I was having doubdts about moving directly into the 301 class but im going to push myself and fully commit all my available energy into this. I'm loving it and feel dedicated to become a better coder.
