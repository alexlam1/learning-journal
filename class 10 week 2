# Journal class 10 week 2 recap

  I've learned about what objects do, functions and constructor functions, how to use them. I learned how to make a form, some CSS tricks, I learned how to build a table, I learned about the DOM. Events, add listeners and getElementById.

  Overall this week my brain feeled like it was not as lost and was actually proccessing some information, I still feel like my heads barely floating above the water but I wont let that stop me from trying.
  
  Here are my note for week 2.

Domain Modeling
Object literal
DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL

Var car = {			VAR declare new car object variable

	Make: 'nissan',		nissan = VALUE
	Model: 'altima',		model = VALUE
	Year: 1988,		YEAR = PROPERTY, 1988 = integer (no ‘’)


Accessories: ['auto', ‘abs', 'turbo'],		ARRAY
	Engine: {
	Make: 'nissan',
	Cylinder: ‘V12'		V12 = OBJECT
	}
}

Object Constructers
Reuseablity
Function -> “new” keyword to instaniate a new object
Dynamically, insert HTML into the DOM through the use of JS

Function Car (make, model, year, accessories, engine) {
This.make = make;
This.model = model;	
CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION -> var nissan = new Car('maxima', 'altima')




Object Consturctors + Tables + Events + Forms
Events -> allow for interactive behavior
	“addEventListener”
	var el = document.getElementById(‘el’); var access element in DOM
	el.addEventListener(‘click’, someFunc);
			Array an event listener to the element


JS DEBUGGING and Chrome dev tools / CSS 3 annotations
Transitions	
JS Events
JS DEBUGGER set breakpoints (pause the JS)
JS console
Elements
Modify styles
Modify / review box model
Name elements in the DOM for testing
Where to locate parent/child relations
