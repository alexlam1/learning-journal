# learning journal 11 week 3 day 1

Honestly I'm more drained then I have been since I've started code fellows, I had an emotional week(end) with my girls health issues, though I've been frantically getting my work done I feel stressed and behind, luckily I have the rest of the week to stay iin late and get caught up. Today we were suppopsed to start the busmall assignment, well I've barely scratched that surface and I feel horrible because of it, for my own self. The chocolate pizza project surprsingly went well! I plotted before I did the work and I felt as if i got alot more of it done at a quicker pace then if fI wouldve tried to do it without the draft. again, unfortuantly, It doesn't look like how I wish it did. But I'm hoping to be able to revise that in class and get it up to par.
