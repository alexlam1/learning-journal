# Learning journal 6 Functions and objects salmon cookie project

Over the week, I've been struggling with functions, today I really pushed myself all day and finally I got what I needed to show up. Honestly, when we turned a literal object into a constructor function it seemed to help with the understanding of objects.

Other then the assignment I found the quiz resourceful I had to go through it a bunch of times to finally get everything I needed. Doing this forced me to read some things such as terminology and learning code talk.

Today I stayed in school working to finish my assignment from the day before until 7. So a late start to the day 3 assignment unfortunately, which can be stressful and intimidating as well. Hopefully, I'll be able to fly through this one, or at least get somewhere in it so that I can get caught back up to date.
