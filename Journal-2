# 201 Journal 2
    Wow! This day 3 assignment kicked my ass. Full throttle put my brain to this and used everything i retained in class including my notes and this helped like none. Fortuantely I got through all the questions with ease but once I got to question 7 all hell broke loose.

    I couldnt figure out fully how to get question 7 to work because when i type in the right answer it doesnt give me a prompt letting me know i was correct.

    Thought this was strange I speent a whole lot of time going through this with TA's and students and i'm still lost. hopefully tommorow ill figure out my problem.

    update: I'm going to submit my project as is and re submit it tommorow when i have the answer to my problem
    update2: Ugh gituation. Wont let me update my repo for github...
