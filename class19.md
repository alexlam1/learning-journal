#week 4 day 4
Today as a group we finished up our project, even though I didn't make any commits to this project I still know I added some support and code to this project, I kind of got really down on myself yesterday when I found out I wouldn't receive a grade for the first two days and sort of gave up on myself. I was really sick and when I went home and took a nap, I woke up with a new perspective, this being instead of looking at my errors and things i didnt do as failures to look at them as learning curves, next time im sure I wont make the same mistakes. Also, I shouldn't let this get ahold of my plans to become a developer. So even though I wont pass the class I still should do these assignments because I'm commited to the program vs. commited to getting the grade, and even though I didnt necesarily pass this doesnt mean I wont be able to practice then test into the 301 course.
