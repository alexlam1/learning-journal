# Week 4 day 3
Today wasn't one of the best days for me but very enlightening, coming to school with the flu was a challenge in itself, then I had to take a whiteboarding exam which I feel as if I would've done much better if I wasn't feeling so damn sick, but it's totally ok because I realize I need more time to work on the material so I dont set myself up for failure come the 301 course. I helped my group with the design aspect of our project but eventually we threw it out the window and stuck with something else thats very basic but user friendly and clean. I'm feeling discouraged but I can't let my challenges be considered as failures, I'm still committed to becoming a programmer, hopefully this month between the next course will be enough to pick me back up on my horse.
